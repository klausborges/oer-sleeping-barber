            <h1>Concepts</h1>
          </div>

          <p>After understanding the Sleeping Barber Problem and the core concepts behind
            the real problems of running asynchronous operations on shared data, we can
            start to work out a solution.</p>

          <p>As in many other problems in various domains of computing, there are more
            than one possible solutions to the problem. We will be analyzing one that 
            involves two thread synchronization mechanisms: <strong>semaphores</strong>
            and <strong>mutexes</strong>.</p>

          <div class="quote">
            <h4>Semaphores</h4>
            <p>A type of variable that counts the number of wakeups saved for future use.
            </p></div>

          <p><i>Dijkstra</i> proposed that semaphores have two operations: <strong>down
            </strong>and <strong>up</strong>.</p>

          <p>The down operation checks if the value of a semaphore is greater than 0. If
            it is, one wakeup saved in the semaphore is used and the process or thread proceeds. However, if the value is 0, the process or thread is put to sleep without completing the down operation. Checking the value on a semaphore and changing it or going to sleep is a single <strong>atomic action</strong>.</p>

          <div class="quote">
            <h4>Atomic Actions</h4>
            <p>Indivisible group of operations that are either all performed without 
              interruptions or are not performed at all.</p></div>

          <p>The up operation adds one wakeup to the semaphore. If one or more processes
            or threads were sleeping due to a down operation on that semaphore, one will
            be chosen arbitrarily by the system and will complete its down operation and
            proceed. This is also an atomic action.</p>

          <div class="quote">
            <h4>Mutexes</h4>
            <p>A simplified version of a semaphore used when the semaphores' ability to
              count and save wakeups is not needed. Mutexes are generally used to manage
              mutual exclusion, having only two states: locked or unlocked.</p></div>

            <h1>Solution</h1>
          </div>

          <p>Now that we have covered all concepts necessary to understand one of the
            possible solutions to the Sleeping Barber Problem, we can start by defining
            how we will be applying these concepts.</p>
          
          <p>For our implementation, we will be using two semaphores and one mutex. One
            of the semaphores will be for the customers in the waiting room and the other
            one will be for the barber. The mutex will be used for mutual exclusion.</p>

          <p>Aside from that, we will need to define the number of chairs in the waiting
            room, which will be our limit on the number of customers and keep a control
            variable of the number of customers currently waiting.</p>

          <p>From the description of the problem, we have that the customer will either
            get a haircut or leave the barbershop; the barber can only cut hair. Those
            three actions will be our functions.</p>

          <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">Barber</div>
            <ul class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item">Sleeps if no one's waiting.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Brings one customer to the barber's chair.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Cuts the customer's hair.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>The barber has only three actions, repeated until he closes the shop. Let's
            analyze each one.</p>

          <p>To check for a client, sleep if no one's waiting and wake up when a customer
            arrives, we run a down operation on the customers semaphore. When a customer
            arrives, the barber brings them to the barber's chair, <strong>and then there
            is one less customer in the waiting room</strong>.
            Now the barber is ready to work. After the hair cut, the barber checks for a
            client and the cycle repeats.</p>

          <div class="panel panel-default">
            <div class="panel-heading">Customer</div>
            <ul class="list-group">
              <li class="list-group-item">Leaves if barbershop is full, waits otherwise.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Sits in the barber's chair.</li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Cuts the customer's hair</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>The customer also has three actions but, unlike the barber, the customer
            only performs his actions once.</p>

          <p>When a customer arrives, he <strong>checks to see if there's a chair
            available in the waiting room</strong>. If there isn't, the customer leaves.
            Otherwise the customer waits, <strong>and the number of customers in the
            waiting room increases</strong>. To wakeup the sleeping barber, the customer
            runs an up on the customers semaphore, and then a down on the barber
            semaphore, waiting to be brought to the barber's chair.</p>

          <p>That is the main part of our solution, but we didn't deal with the mutex for
            the possible race condition. The critical region is the highlighted part in
            both role descriptions, where they read and write from the variable that
            keeps count of the number of customers waiting.</p>

          <p>After wrapping the highlighted parts in both the customer and the barber
            with the mutex, the problem is solved!</p>
