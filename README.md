# Adding code implementations of the problem

Code implementations of solutions to the problem should be located at FOLDER,
where they will be automatically located. Convention is to name the files as
language-name.ext, where language-name should be ..., and ext is the usual
extension type of the language source code files.
For example, `python.py` for a Python implementation of the solution.

Code implementations will have syntax highlighting provided by PrismJS, but
the pre-built PrismJS files included in this project only support highlighting
for:

* C-like languages
* JavaScript
* Python
* Go
* Java

This decision reflects in a minimal JS code to optimize page loading times,
if an implementation in a different language is included, PrismJS should be
rebuilt. Rebuilding can be done from PrismJS's source or from their download
page, where language-specific syntax highlighters, features (such as line
numbering), and themes can be selected.
