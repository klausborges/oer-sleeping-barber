          <p>The Sleeping Barber problem is an inter-process communication and
            synchronization problem. The original variation of the problem is attributed
            to <i>Dijkstra</i>, but we will work with the following variation:</p>

          <div class="quote"><p>A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n chairs, and
            the barber room containing the barber chair. If there are no customers to be
            served, the barber goes to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and all
            chairs are occupied, then the customer leaves the shop. If the barber is busy,
            but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs. If
            the barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber.</p></div>

          <p>Another way to look at the Sleeping Barber Problem is to think of the
            Producer-Consumer problem, except that the roles of Producer and Consumer are
            not analogous to the usual business point of view where usually the Producer
            would be the barber and the Consumer would be the customer.</p>

          <p>Customers are <strong>produced</strong> when they come to the barbershop, and
            barbers <strong>consume</strong> the customers when they give them haircuts.
          </p>

          <p>Some concepts are vital to keep in mind before proposing a solution to this
            problem, such as <strong>race conditions</strong>.</p>

          <div class="quote">
            <h4>Race Conditions</h4>
            <p>Processes or threads that are working together may share common storage
              that is used to read and write, whether it is located in memory or in a
              shared file. Race conditions are situations where the final result of an
              operation on the shared data depends on which process or thread runs
              precisely when.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Avoiding <strong>race conditions</strong> requires that read and write 
            operations on shared data are never done at the same time when executed by
            more than one process or thread simultaneously. Which brings us to another 
            important concept, <strong>mutual exclusion</strong>.</p>

          <div class="quote">
            <h4>Mutual Exclusion</h4>
            <p>Ensuring that while one process or thread is performing read or write 
              operations on shared data others are prohibited of doing the same.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Processes and threads aren't always executing operations that might lead to
            race conditions, part of the time they are running internal computations
            outside of their <strong>critical region</strong>.</p>

          <div class="quote">
            <h4>Critical Region</h4>
            <p>Part of the program where the shared memory or file is accessed.</p>
          </div>

          <p>To have processes or threads running in parallel and cooperating efficiently
            while using shared data, we need four conditions to be satisfied.
          </p>

          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">1. No two or more can be simultaneously inside
              their critical region.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">2. No assumptions may be made about number of CPUs
              or speed.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">3. No blocking others while outside the critical
              region.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">4. It should not take long to enter the critical
              region.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
